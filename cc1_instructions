Coding Challenge #1

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:

BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass 
OR
(height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).

Your tasks:

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data:

Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95m tall.
Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76m tall.


Here I use const to assign variable names that are clear and easy to identify and then we assign the values with =
** let is possible here too, I know the values in this challenge won't change so const is the better option **
